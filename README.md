# PatchedUp Controllers

A collection of patches that aim to improve controller support for the game PlateUp.

### Changes
* Controller bind overrides get properly applied to your profile.
* Controller binds no longer get applied to your keyboard.
* Controller bind overrides are now dependent on the controller type used. ex: Binds made using a DualSense controller will only apply when using another DuelSense controller, and only on the selected profile.
* Bind overrides are saved in a separate file from the profile saves. Uninstall without fear of bricking your save.
* Added missing sprite paths for certain buttons, such as pressing in your sticks.
